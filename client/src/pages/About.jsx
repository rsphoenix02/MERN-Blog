              <b>Our Mission: Beyond Academics</b>
              <br />

              exam scores and parental expectations. Your well-being matters
              just as much as your academic pursuits, and we're here to remind
              you that there's more to life than the results of a single exam.

              <b>A Note on Mental Health : You Are Not Alone</b> <br />
              We acknowledge the pervasive mental health
              challenges that JEE aspirants face, and we want you to know that
              it's okay not to be okay. The pressure can be overwhelming, and we
              urge you to prioritize your mental health. Remember, reaching out
              for support is a sign of strength. If you or someone you know is
              struggling, don't hesitate to contact a mental health professional
              or reach out to a friend. <br />
